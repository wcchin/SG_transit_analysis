% spatial network as a tool to understand the disease diffusion process

% super-spreaders, which is a popular social network analysis topic, could provide some insights on revealing the places that were influential in the disease diffusion process and on uncovering the vulnerable places. 

% the focuses of this study
The aim of this study is to identify the super-spreader and super-receiver in a commuting network. A spatial super-spreader is a location where a lot of people are moving from, and those people are moving to different places; a spatial super-receiver is the destination of a large number of commuters, who come from different places. In other words, there is two keys to identify super-spreader and super-receiver, which is local density and neighborhood diversity (REF). The local densities  of a location are the number of people leaving from or reaching to the location. The neighborhood diversities contains two type of diversity, one of which is the diversity of zones, i.e. are the people come from different parts of the country; another is the diversity of coreness, i.e. are the people come from different types of the country in terms of core or peripheral areas. In this study, we present the analysis of Singapore public transport flow network, and identify the spatial super-spreaders and super-receivers using the spreader and receiver indexes, which were calculated based on the local densities and neighborhood diversities measurements. The population flow pattern may be different for weekday and weekend. Thus, the flow data were separated into two parts, weekday and weekend, to show the differences of super-spreaders and super receivers during weekdays and weekends.
