% Infectious disease, COVID-19 
Until the preparation of this article, the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, or  nCoV-2019, caused by SARS-CoV-2) is still an ongoing issue with the reported cases surpassed 200,000 [@whoCoronavirusDisease2019a]. The pathology of the COVID-19 remained an open issue [@luGenomicCharacterisationEpidemiology2020, @huangClinicalFeaturesPatients2020], and the development of the vaccines and medicines for treating COVID-19 are still under processing. To the current understanding, COVID-19 is more infectious than the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (caused by SARS-CoV-1) [@yangEpidemiologicalClinicalFeatures2020, @riouPatternEarlyHumantohuman2020], the main transmission method is through respiratory droplets, and the infected patients would experience a (about) 14 days latent period before starting to have symptoms and become infectious [@liEarlyTransmissionDynamics2020, @whoNovelCoronavirus2019nCoVb]. The asymptomatic latent period of COVID-19 and its highly contagious disease properties had made COVID-19 even more difficult to be control and prevent [@riouPatternEarlyHumantohuman2020]. 

The outbreak of COVID-19 started in December 2019 at Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, which started to spread worldwide in January of 2020, lead to the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO [@whoNovelCoronavirus2019nCoV]. Until the declaration of PHEIC, 7818 cases were confirmed, in which 82 were out of China cases [@whoNovelCoronavirus2019nCoV]. In February, the COVID-19 started to spread internationally, especially to the East and South East Asia, and some European countries who had intensive direct population flow from China. The first wave of international spreading occurred partially because of the end of Chinese New Year holiday and the evacuation of citizens from China, or direct interactions with people who had traveled to Wuhan City, China [@whoCoronavirusDisease2019c]. The countries in this first wave of outbreak included Thailand, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, France, Germany and United Kingdom [@whoCoronavirusDisease2019b]. Those imported cases had quickly developed to local transmission in most countries. In March, as the outbreak occurred in Italy, Spain, France, and Germany, the epicenter of COVID-19 moved to Europe [@whoCoronavirusDisease2019a], which were the second wave of outbreak and international pandemic. The second wave outbreak triggered the lock-down in some of the European countries. The purpose of the country or city level lock-down is to introduce social distancing, reduce the chances of imported cases, and to restrict the human movement to stop the disease spreading spatially within the country.  

% from central to influential powers, opinion leaders, super-spreaders, which is a popular social network analysis topic, could provide some insights on revealing the places that were influential in the disease diffusion process and on uncovering the vulnerable places. 
The identification of super-spreaders is a popular topic in social network studies [@pastor-satorrasEpidemicSpreadingScaleFree2001, @kitsakIdentificationInfluentialSpreaders2010, @fuIdentifyingSuperSpreaderNodes2015, @liuIdentifyingMultipleInfluential2018]. The 20/80 rule was observed in most disease diffusion studies, indicated that about 20% of the people were responsible for the 80% spread of an infectious disease; namely the super-spreaders [@steinSuperspreadersInfectiousDiseases2011, @edholmSearchingSuperspreadersIdentifying2018]. The identification of super-spreaders has great theoretical significance and high potential of practical applications in terms of disease control, hence attract large attention in researchers community and public sectors. Previous studies focused on social networks, in which nodes as people and links as their social interactions, to search for the most influential people by using network analysis metrics, including degree, closeness and betweenness centralities, the k-shell decomposition, or the modification based on these measurements. [@kitsakIdentificationInfluentialSpreaders2010, @liuRankingSpreadingInfluence2013, @zengRankingSpreadersDecomposing2013, @heNovelTopkStrategy2015, @wangMaximizingSpreadInfluence2016, @liuIdentifyingMultipleInfluential2018]. In some recent studies, researchers indicated that the characteristics of neighboring nodes (the semi-local information or local structure) is efficient in quantifying the nodes' spreading capability [@chenIdentifyingInfluentialNodes2012, @gaoRankingSpreadingAbility2014, @liIdentificationInfluentialSpreaders2018].  On the other hand, some studies pointed out that on the search of multiple (top-k) super-spreaders, there were chances that the identified nodes by the local or semi-local measurements might located at the same network community, which would restrict the spreading events occurred only within the same community. Thus, they developed some methods that considered the community structure while identifying the top-k super-spreaders [@zhangIdentifyingInfluentialNodes2013, @heNovelTopkStrategy2015]. In summary, previous studies had shown that two node characteristics are important while quantifying the influential power of a node, including the node's local information--the immediate interactions with its neighboring nodes, and the node's position within the network--its connection to the rest of the network, e.g. if it is connected to all of the communities. To integrate the nodes' local indicators and the nodes' global topological index, Fu et al. proposed a two-step framework to develop the index for identifying the super-spreaders [@fuIdentifyingSuperSpreaderNodes2015]. 

% spatial network as a tool to understand the disease diffusion process
Although the concept of super-spreaders focused on the person based social interactions, it is not practically applicable for the country-wide or city-wide analysis and policy establishing because of the difficulties on acquiring person-to-person interaction co-presence data and person-based policy making for everyone in the whole country or city. Therefore, previous studies attempted to used spatial network to conceptualize the networked interactions between places [@barthelemySpatialNetworks2011] for the understanding of spatial disease diffusion [@laiUnderstandingSpatialClustering2004, @colizzaEpidemicModelingMetapopulation2008, @balcanModelingSpatialSpread2010a, @chinGeocomputationalAlgorithmExploring2017a]. People move from places to places at all time. The movements would provide the opportunity of infectious diseases spreading as viruses or pathogens could be transferred between people [@hsiehImpactTravelPatches2007, @stoddardRoleHumanMovement2009b, @nicolaidesMetricInfluentialSpreading2012]. Previous studies stated that the urban structures could be used to rank the concentration of human activity and population density [@jiangRankingSpacesPredicting2009b, @zhongDetectingDynamicsUrban2014, @chinGeographicallyModifiedPageRank2015b]. In order to integrate the human movement, individual interactions and the disease spreading model (e.g. susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, or SEIR model), previous studies applied the metapopulation model to simulate the disease diffusion dynamic process [@colizzaEpidemicModelingMetapopulation2008, @balcanModelingSpatialSpread2010a, @meloniModelingHumanMobility2011e]. In summary, spatial networks could be useful on uncovering the spatial structures behind the disease diffusion networks, and provide insights and decision making supports for country-wide or city-wide. But, most of previous spatial network studies on disease diffusion focused on the space-time development and potential impacts of the disease, and none of which made discussion on the most influential geographical units, namely the spatial super-spreaders. 

% vulnerability, receiver, HITS authorities
In addition to the concept of super-spreaders, this study would also describe and discuss the super-receivers. While the concept super-spreaders focuses on the ability to spread a disease, the super-receivers concept emphasizes on the vulnerability of receiving the disease [@aralIdentifyingInfluentialSusceptible2012, @mooreTrackingSocioeconomicVulnerability2014, @porphyreVulnerabilityBritishSwine2017c]. In other words, the aim of the identification of super-receiver is to find the most susceptible node within the network. One similar concept in spatial analysis is the low-high outliers, that is, the location with low density of disease cases which is surrounded by high density locations, thus it is more vulnerable as it had higher possibility to get large cases in the next time period [@dhewantaraGeographicalTemporalDistribution2018]. In network analysis field, the concepts of spreaders and receivers appeared in the HITS algorithm [@kleinbergHubsAuthoritiesCommunities1999] as hubs and authorities, respectively. In HITS algorithm, hub describes the level of being a high influential node and authority represents the popularity of being a destination. 


% the focuses of this study
The aim of this study is to identify the spatial super-spreader and spatial super-receiver in an island country's spatial commuting network. A spatial super-spreader is a location where a lot of people are originated from, and those people are moving to a high variety of places; a spatial super-receiver is the destination of a large number of commuters, who come from different places. In this study, we developed two indexes, namely the spreader index and receiver index for the identification of spatial super-spreaders and spatial super-receivers, which considered two key components: the local strength of flows and the diversity of its neighborhood [@fuIdentifyingSuperSpreaderNodes2015]. The local strength of flows for a location is the number of people leaving from or coming to the location, i.e. respectively the weighted out-degree and weighted in-degree. The neighborhood diversities would be captured by two type concepts: one of which is the diversity of zones, i.e. are the people come from different parts of the country; another is the diversity of coreness, i.e. are the people come from different types of the country in terms of core or peripheral areas. We applied the analysis framework to the Singapore public transport flow network, and identify the spatial super-spreaders and spatial super-receivers using the spreader and receiver indexes. The population flow pattern may be different for weekday and weekend. Thus, the flow data were separated into two parts, weekday and weekend, for the discussion on the differences of super-spreaders and super receivers during weekdays and weekends.
